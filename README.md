## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Melody! I study Computer Science and Philosophy at Northeastern University. I love writing clean code, product management, and figuring out what it means to be human.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on dayloom, an automated hardware/software system to streamline my morning and evening routines. This project is funded by the Honors Propel Grant!
